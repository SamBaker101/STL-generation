# STL-generation
Using python to generate and manipulate STL files

## Roadmap
- [x] Open and Close STL Files
- [x] Scale an STL file
- [x] Rotate an STL file
- [ ] Generate simple shapes (Cube, Pyramid)
- [ ] Generate a sphere at a given resolution
- [ ] Add champfers to simple shapes
- [ ] Add fillets to simple shapes
- [ ] Stitch models together
- [ ] Selectively scale more complex models (eg. Scale overall dimensions while maintaining wall thickness)
