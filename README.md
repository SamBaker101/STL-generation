# STL-generation
Using python to generate and manipulate STL files

## Roadmap
- Open and Close STL Files
- Scale an STL file
- Rotate an STL file
- Generate simple shapes (Cube, Pyramid)
- Generate a sphere at a given resolution
- Add champfers to simple shapes
- Add fillets to simple shapes
- Stitch models together
- Selectively scale more complex models (eg. Scale overall dimensions while maintaining wall thickness)
